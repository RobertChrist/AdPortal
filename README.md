In 2014, I applied for a position for a Senior Developer role at a company named MediaRadar.

I worked there for 7 years, in which time I ultimately came to oversee all Internal engineering teams, in my position as Director of Internal Engineering.

During that tenure, I changed the coding exercise that MediaRadar gives to new applicants from what is seen here, to a different style of exercise.  And in 2021, I accepted a new role at a different company.

As such, I thought it was safe, and a bit fun, to put my original application coding sample back on Github.

If anyone from MediaRadar sees this, I hope you all are doing well, and as always, I hope we continue to stay in touch.
